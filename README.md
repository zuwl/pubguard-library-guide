# Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to get the Pubguard library running on your iOS/Android app.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the pubguard library you will need an application key which is available from your account, in order to receive a key please signup from https://www.pubguard.com or email support@pubguard.com. The key is used in both the iOS and Android installations.

```
pubguardKey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

# Android


The latest version of the Android Pubguard Library is **1.13.0**

**NB do not minify the Pubguard library**



### Installing

Installing the Pubguard library requires the following lines to be added to your gradle build as follows:

#### Using Maven

Please add the following lines to your **build.Gradle(Module: app)** and update the credentials to use your key in 'password':

```
repositories {
    maven {
            url 'https://customer.pubguard.com/maven/releases'

            credentials {
            username 'pubguard'
            password 'YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE'
            }
        }
}

dependencies {
...
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:[GOOGLE_AD_VERSION]'
    implementation 'com.pubguard:pubguard-client:1.13.0'

}

```
Note that we require `implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:[GOOGLE_AD_VERSION]'`
[GOOGLE_AD_VERSION] Version is based on your google ads version as per above. Even if you are not using Google ads, you still need to add support for Google services.


#### Initialising the Library

The Pubguard Library should be initialised once at app launch, Here's an example of how to call the init method in your AppDelegate:

```
import com.pubguard.client.Pubguard;
…

public class QuizzyApplication extends Application {

    @Override public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        Pubguard.init(this, "YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE");
        }
}
```

#### Proguard

If you are using Proguard please see our section on [using Pubguard with Proguard](drd-proguard-guide.md).

---

# iOS

The latest version of the iOS Pubguard Library is **1.16.0**

### Installing

There are 2 methods of installing the Pubguard framework:

#### Using cocoapods

Please add the following line to your Podfile (adding in your app key):

```
pod 'Pubguard', podspec: 'https://customer.pubguard.com/cocoapods/pubguard-ios-framework/1.16.0/Pubguard-1.16.0.podspec?access_token=YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE'
```

Then run "pod install --repo-update"

#### Adding the library manually

If you are adding the library manually please refer to these [instructions](ios-manual-install.md).


#### Unity installation

Unity supports installation via cocoapods and manual installation. Framework must be installed in Xcode project, which you get after building Unity project for iOS platform.

##### cocoapods (Unity)

Please add the following line to your Podfile (adding in your app key):

```
pod 'Pubguard', podspec: 'https://customer.pubguard.com/cocoapods/pubguard-ios-framework/1.16.0/Pubguard-1.16.0.podspec?access_token=YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE'
```

Then run "pod install --repo-update"

##### manual (Unity)

Manual installation is the same [instructions](ios-manual-install.md).

### Initialising the Library

The Pubguard Library should be initialised once at app launch, Here's an example of how to call the init method in your AppDelegate:

#### Swift

The Pubguard Library is written in Obj-c so if your app is Swift please see the guide on adding a [bridging header](adding-a-bridging-header.md).

```
*Example AppDelegate.m (excerpt)*

import Pubguard
…

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

        func application(_ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        // Initialize the Pubguard Library.
        Pubguard.initiateTrackerWithKey("YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE")

        return true
    }

}
```

#### Objective-C

```
*Example AppDelegate.m (excerpt)*

#import "Pubguard/Pubguard.h"
…

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    // Initialize the Pubguard Library.
    [Pubguard initiateTrackerWithKey:@"YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE"];
    return YES;
}

@end
```


#### Unity

As was mentioned earlier, pubguard installation and initialization must be in Xcode project, which you get after building Unity project for iOS platform. In this project find **UnityAppController.mm** file and find **application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** function. Add ```[Pubguard initiateTrackerWithKey:@"YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE"];```.

```
*Example UnityAppController.mm (excerpt)*

#import <Pubguard/Pubguard.h>
…

@implementation UnityAppController

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    // Initialize the Pubguard Library.
    [Pubguard initiateTrackerWithKey:@"YOUR_PUBGUARD_KEY_HERE"];
    return YES;
}

@end
```
